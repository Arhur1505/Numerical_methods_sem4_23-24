# Numerical Methods
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Numerical Methods** course, offered in the fourth semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course focuses on fundamental numerical methods and their applications, including:

- Floating-point arithmetic and numerical errors.
- Solving linear systems using direct and iterative methods.
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation.
- Solving nonlinear equations and systems.
- Interpolation and approximation techniques.
- Numerical integration using Newton-Cotes and Gauss quadrature.
- Function minimization and optimization methods.
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applications.
- Monte Carlo integration techniques.
- Random number generation and statistical testing.

Laboratory exercises were conducted using **C++ and Python**, depending on the problem and the computational efficiency of each language.

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to develop numerical computation skills and practical algorithm implementation.
